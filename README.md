# Learn Intermediate Go (LIG)

Learn Intermediate Go (LIG) series was designed to help you fill some knowledge gaps just beyond the basic Go tutorials. It aims to contain an essence extracted from things that commonly frustrate you, or what you've missed while working on the first projects after the basic tutorials. Intended audiences are:

- you have experience in another language but new to Go, or
- you just finished a basic tutorial (e.g. Tour of Go), but unsure how to gain further knowledge, or
- you've been writing Go for a few months but want to fill some gaps in your knowledge
